          Next to our Elite Complex, there are a number of sprawling slums. I always thought that I
          must do something for the people of these areas who have equal rights to live decent lives
          just as we do. They must get the basic education and health facilities. What kind of
          society or nation we are going to create when millions of people are in dire need of food,
          education and elementary health facilities?. During one of my visits to these areas I came
          across Sona Sarovar Trust and in particular Ms. Sona Kumar who has been doing exemplary
          work in her own small way. Since then I have been supporting her by contributing my time
          and the fund.

          I had visited Mirkapada village in Bhiwandi Distt along with Trustees of Sona Sarovar
          Trust for water project. I have attended their meetings at Slum Areas for formation of
          Self Help Groups etc.. I am so impressed with their dedication that I refer their name to
          Social Workers for guidance.
